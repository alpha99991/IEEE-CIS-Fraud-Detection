# IEEE-CIS-Fraud-Detection

Was a part of Kaggle Competition and data was taken from there

The objective was to build a machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions in the future based on the previous transactions given.
  1) Each of the distribution of data of all the features were viewed and redundant features were discarded based on statistical analysis.
  2) Feature engineering and encoding schemes has been performed to check which method gives better accuracy
  3) Time consistency test was performed to discard certain useless features 
  4) XGBoost and Isolation Forest Algorithm has been used after suitable preprocessing of the data
  5) Sampling methods like SMOTE and Tomek Links were used in conjunction with algorithms to further improve accuracy
  6) Memory Reduction has been done based on redundant memory storage to reduce both computation time and memory consumption
